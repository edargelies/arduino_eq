Attempted filtering again with no luck
Filters require heavy floating point mathematical operations that the arduino sadly cannot complete in a timely fashion
best bet is filter libraries; however, these proved to be no useful

New plan implement simple "filtering" audio effects (phaser, ring mod)

LED matrix
Got it working with the new hardware, cleaned up code.  Need to add better comments and explain algorithm
Arduino is not multithreaded, cannot output input data while performing other operations.  Cannot view and hear at the same time with
an audio passthrough
Tried to resolve lack of threading with interrupt routine, Somewhat succesful however output is harsh and heavily downsampled
(porting audio in to audio out in the interrupt routine, doing the led calculation in the loop)
