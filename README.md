Directory structure
--------------------------------------------------

Arduino_eq – This contains the reports for each lab

Libraries – This directory contains the Arduino libraries I used for the labs.  The source code for each lab will have a #include stating which libraries are being used.

Sketchbook – This is the source code for my labs.  In my source code there may be code snippets from other sources such as Amanda Ghassaei and M Nawrath.  I have called these out in the comments.


Videos - To save space in this submission I've uploaded all of my videos to 
YouTube. The link to the playlist is:

The videos are in order with the projects as I completed them.  The titles 
correspond to the names of the reports.
