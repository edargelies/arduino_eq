Directory structure
--------------------------------------------------

Arduino_eq – This contains the reports for each lab

Libraries – This directory contains the Arduino libraries I used for the labs.  The source code for each lab will have a #include stating which libraries are being used.

Sketchbook – This is the source code for my labs.  In my source code there may be code snippets from other sources such as Amanda Ghassaei and M Nawrath.  I have called these out in the comments.

Arduinovids – This is a collection of video demos I took for the various labs in .mp4 format.  The videos are sorted in subdirectories corresponding to the four reports.
